/*
 * The routine runtime: an interpreter for yield components on Solid's public API.
 *
 * Nothing here is compiled. Every operation a routine delegates to with
 * `yield*` runs inside its own iterator and returns its result without
 * yielding, so `yield* count` is a plain tracked call of `count` in whatever
 * computation is running the routine. The only operation that yields to a
 * driver is an async `attempt`: the memo / event runner suspends the
 * generator on its promise and resumes it when the promise settles.
 *
 * Views: after the JSX transform's one yield rule (`yield* e` inside JSX
 * becomes `perform(e)`), a view generator has no `yield` left and runs once;
 * each hole is its own computation. A view has no body (D-032): a read at its
 * top level — outside a JSX position or a hole — is the development error
 * `READ_IN_VIEW`.

 * may return an `Error` on one path and not on another is

 * handler would be just a call.
 *
 * When `fn` returns a promise the routine suspends until it settles ($memo

 *
 * When it returns an event call (D-077), `yield* attempt(() => post(msg), e =>
 * { … })` is `yield* post(msg)` with the call's failure handled: the handler
 * receives the call's typed failure (its `FailsOf`) and returns it, a
 * transformation, or nothing; the call's other colors (`P`, `A`) are the
 * routine's as with `yield*`. Only a typed failure (one `raise`d, or returned
 * by a handler) reaches it, in every build: a crash inside the call — a
 * plain `throw`, a `TypeError` — is a bug, and goes past the handler
 * (D-087). This is how a routine handles a failure — `try` /
 * `catch` is not a routine form (`no-try-catch`).

 * and `READ_IN_SETUP` in development) and a view reads only in its holes,
 * each its own computation, so a component called in a hole subscribes that
 * hole to nothing of its own.
 * The component's failures are its view's and its setup's effects' (`FailsOf<Y>`,
 * D-073): an `$effect` fails to the nearest `Errored` above it.
 * Its requirements (D-098) are its view's — the components it calls, less
 * what a `Ctx.provide` in the view gives them — and its setup's context
 * reads (`RequiresOf<Y>`), which were resolved where the component was
 * created: a provider in its own view cannot give them.
 *
 * Two signatures (D-098 amended). A setup that is not generic gets a call
 * generic in its props literal (`HoleCall`), so the call's view carries
 * what its hole props require (`HoleRequires`). A generic setup (D-029)
 * fails that overload (TypeScript cannot infer its props) and gets the
 * plain function type, which keeps its type parameters: TypeScript passes a
 * generic argument's type parameters on only to a result with one
 * non-generic call signature. Its hole props carry no requirement.
