/*
 * Yield components for Solid, as a library: strict generator syntax, its
 * types, and a runtime interpreter on Solid's public API. No yield
 * compiler; the JSX transform's one yield rule (`yield*` inside JSX becomes
 * `perform(…)`) makes JSX views fine-grained.
 *
 * See documentation/yield-library.md.
 *
 * The runtime's marks and helpers that the `h` entry shares (one runtime per
 * app) are not exported here: they are `solid-yield/internal`, which is not
 * a documented entry and makes no compatibility promise.
