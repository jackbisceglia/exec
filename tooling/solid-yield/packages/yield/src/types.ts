 * The type model of yield components.

 * to with `yield*`, and TypeScript collects the delegated operations' yield
 * types into the generator's yield union. The constructors (`component`,
 * `$memo`, `$effect`, `$event`, row routines) constrain that union: each kind
 * of routine admits a fixed set of operations, so a disallowed operation is a
 * type error at the constructor call.
 *
 * Two facts travel with values: whether reading them may be *pending*
 * (async, not yet resolved) and which errors reading them may *fail* with.
 * Operations carry them as phantom fields; `PendingOf` / `FailsOf` fold a
 * yield union into them. A third fact is a marker only: a view that binds an
 * event which may wait on a pending read *may wait* (`MayWaitOf`, D-075). It
 * never makes the view pending — the runtime does not suspend a view for a
 * call. A fourth fact is a context requirement (D-098): a component whose
 * setup reads a context created without a default *requires* it
 * (`RequiresOf`), until a `Ctx.provide(…)` around its call discharges it.
 * Nothing here exists at runtime.
