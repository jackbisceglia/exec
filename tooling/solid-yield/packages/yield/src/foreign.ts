/*
 * `foreign(Comp)`: a yield component handed to foreign code (D-088). Plain
 * Solid — the router's `component`, `@solidjs/web`'s `render`, Solid's
 * `lazy` — takes a component as a value and renders it with no `yield*`, so
 * no type carries the component's colors past the handoff. Pending has a
 * place to go there (the app's `Loading`, which plain Solid uses too); a
 * failure does not. So a component handed over must handle its own
 * failures: it is `View<boolean, never>`. `foreign` checks that where the
 * handoff is written, and is the identity at run time. The lint
 * `no-unchecked-foreign-handoff` reports a handoff written without it.
 *
 * Its requirements (D-098) have nowhere to go either, unless the author
 * says which providers sit above the foreign edge (D-102): `foreign(Page, {
 * provided: [ThemeCtx] })` — typically an app-wide provider above a router
 * — takes those contexts off what `Page` requires. The claim is the
 * author's; the runtime checks it where `Page` is created (`NO_PROVIDER`
 * when no provider is there). Listing a context `Page` does not require is
 * refused (`[NOT_REQUIRED]`), so the list stays the true one.
